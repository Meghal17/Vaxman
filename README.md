### Vax-Man in Python with PyGame

This is an implemetation of Vax-Man game for the Electronic Arts Software Engineering 
Virtual Experience program. The game is made by modifying the open source implementation of 
Pacman from: https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman.

Here's how Vax-Man is different from Pacman:

1. Vaxman can kill a ghost when it comes into contact with it and this does not kill Vaxman.
2. Every ghost that has yet not been killed multiplies itself every 30 seconds.
3. To win the game Vax-Man must collect all the yellow dots before the population of ghosts grows 
   to 2 times its original population.
